When asked to generate a Git commit message, follow the Conventional Commits format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `refactor:` for code changes that donâ€™t fix bugs or add features
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- Start the message in lowercase and keep it short and clear.
